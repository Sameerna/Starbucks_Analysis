This project mainly deals with the analyse the offers provided by the starbucks mobile application 
The analysis is about the number of customers looking at the offer and actually using it.

With EDA I was able to conclude that 

1) Women (Females) were more intreasted in the offers 
2) People with their income of around $40-$60K a year would be a member and have placed the maximum number of orders 
3) Out of all the members registered Half of them view the offer the other half don't
  and in that half of them redeem the offer and the others do not use the offer at all.
